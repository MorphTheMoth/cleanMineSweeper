i wanted to play minesweeper, but all the sites i found had something i didn't like, so i decided to make my own.

fetaure:

- at the start a random '0' cell will be automatically revealed with all her neighbours

[left click] / [a]:               - reveals hidden number/bomb.

[right click] / [d] / [space]:    - if you click a hidden cell, you will mark it as a bomb.
                                  - if you click a number it will reveal all hidden cells around, except if you marked those cells as bombs.


- you lose when you click a bomb.
- you win when all the numbers are revealed and all the bombs are marked correctly.

- after you win/lose you have to press F5 or refresh the page to retry.
